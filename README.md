Hello! This is my website called Tutor Corps -- mainly focusing on providing resources to students in need and remote + free volunteer opprotunities. I was inspired to make this website because of the GirlsWhoCode Pathways Web Development Track.


I am also new to writing readme files so here is a basic crackdown: 
**HTML files**
1) index.html - home page
2) quiz.html - page for "Which Organization Suits You" quiz 
3) Organizations.html - page listing each organization and their unique attributes
4) Mission.html - states the purpose of the website and how it can help students + volunteers 

**CSS files**
1) style.css - styles EVERYTHING for the website 

**JS files**
1) index.js -- Currently empty but stay tune for future website updates! I plan to add more interactive features. 
2) script.js -- Javascript file to program the quiz in quiz.html
