Hello! This is my website called Tutor Corps -- mainly focusing on providing resources to students in need and remote + free volunteer opprotunities.

I was inspired to make this website because of the GirlsWhoCode Pathways Web Development Track. 

I made my project first in Replit and transferred the code over to Visual Studio. I proceed to then upload it to Github (You're here!). 

I really struggled with getting the javascript file to load with the quiz.html page. I had looked into multiple sources and it turns out -- the first Javascript page is loaded onto the first HTML page. If you set variables, they won't be in the next html page. This explains why the variables in my quiz would not work and run into an error! Now I know to make a javascript page individually for each HTML page.


I am also new to writing readme files so here is a basic crackdown: 
**HTML files**
1) index.html - home page
2) quiz.html - page for "Which Organization Suits You" quiz 
3) Organizations.html - page listing each organization and their unique attributes
4) Mission.html - states the purpose of the website and how it can help students + volunteers 

**CSS files**
1) style.css - styles EVERYTHING for the website 

**JS files**
1) index.js -- Currently empty but stay tune for future website updates! I plan to add more interactive features. 
2) script.js -- Javascript file to program the quiz in quiz.html
