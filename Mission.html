      <p class="MainText"><strong>FOR STUDENTS AND PARENTS: </strong> </p>
      <p class = "normal">We understand that tutoring, especially 1:1, can be expensive. With our resources, you can explore multiple organizations that helps you or your child.</p>

      <p class="MainText"> <strong> FOR TUTORS </strong>: </p>
      <p class = "normal">Not everyone has the ability to help out on the weekends or after-school every day due to personal issues. With our resources, students/adults can find free, flexible, and remote volunteering opportunities that can be done at any time anywhere as long as you have an Internet connection, a working electronic device, and preferably a microphone! <br> </p>
