      <h3 id = "call "> There have been multiple attempts by the Trump Admistration to dismantle the United States Department of Education. Its budget and workforce has been significantly reduced. The Department of Education's main priority is to help reduce the inequality and funding gaps between all Americans. We urge you to call your rep's office today. Below is a script template for you when you call your representatives.</h3>
